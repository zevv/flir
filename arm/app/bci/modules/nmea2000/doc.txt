The following NMEA 2000 PGN commands are supported by the Remote Switch:

- PGN 060928: ISO Address claim
- PGN 127506: DC Detailed Status
- PGN 127508: Battery Status

== Periodic Data Transmitted PGNs

[width="70%",cols="1s,1e,1m,4"]

  | Field 1 | SID             | uint8 |
  
    The sequence identifier field is used to tie related PGNs together. For
    example, the Remote Switch will transmit identical SIDs for 127506 (DC
    Detailed Status) and 127508 (Battery Status) to indicate that the readings
    are linked together (i.e., the data from each PGN was taken at the same
    time although they are reported at slightly different times).
  
  | Field 2 | DC Instance     | uint8 |
  
    This field indicates the particular DC source or battery for which this data
    applies. The remote switch will always have an instance of 0
  
  | Field 3 | DC Type         | uint8 |
  
    This field indicates the type of DC source being monitored.  0=Battery,
    1=Alternator, 2=Convertor, 3=Solar Cell, 4=Wind Generator. The remote switch
    will always report a DC type of 0 (Battery)
  
  | Field 4 | State of Charge | uint8 |
  
    This field indicates the state of charge of a battery in units of 1%.
  
  | Field 5 | State of Health | uint8 |
  
    This field always contains a value of 100 (no State of Health calculation).
  
  | Field 6 | Time Remaining  | uint16 |
  
    This field indicates the time remaining to the discharge floor at the current
    rate of discharge in units of 1 minute.
  
  | Field 7 | Ripple Voltage  | uint16 |
    
    This field always contains a value of 0

=== PGN 127508: Battery Status

 
[width="70%",cols="1s,1e,1m,4"]
|===


  | Field 1 | Battery Instance  | uint8 |
  
    This field indicates the particular DC source or battery for which this
    data applies. The remote switch will always have an instance of 0

  | Field 2 | Battery Voltage | uint16 |
  
    This field indicates the voltage of the battery in units of 10 mV.
  
  | Field 3 | Battery Current |  uint16 |
  
    This field indicates the current flowing through the battery in units of
    0.1A. Positive values denote that charging current, negative values denote
    discharge current.
  
  | Field 4 | Battery Case Temperature  | uint16 |
  
    This field indicates the temperature of the batterys case in units of
    0.01K.

  | Field 5 | SID  | uint8 |
  
    The sequence identifier field is used to tie related PGNs together. For
    example, the Remote Switch will transmit identical SIDs for 127506 (DC
    Detailed Status) and 127508 (Battery Status) to indicate that the readings
    are linked together (i.e., the data from each PGN was taken at the same
    time although they are reported at slightly different times).
